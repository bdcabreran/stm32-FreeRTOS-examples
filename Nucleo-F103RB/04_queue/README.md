# Semaphore FreeRTOs example

In FreeRTOS, a semaphore is a synchronization object used to manage access to shared resources between tasks. It is a special type of binary semaphore that can be used to signal the availability of a resource, and to block a task until that resource is available.

## Here are some important aspects of semaphores in FreeRTOS:

**Resource sharing:** Semaphores are useful for managing shared resources, such as memory buffers or communication channels, among different tasks in a FreeRTOS application. By using a semaphore to guard access to the resource, tasks can coordinate their use of the resource and avoid conflicts.

**Mutual exclusion:** Semaphores can be used to implement mutual exclusion, which is a technique to prevent multiple tasks from accessing a shared resource at the same time. By setting the semaphore count to one, only one task can acquire the semaphore at a time, effectively serializing access to the shared resource.

**Priority inversion:** Semaphores in FreeRTOS support priority inheritance, which helps avoid priority inversion. Priority inversion is a situation where a higher-priority task is blocked by a lower-priority task that holds a semaphore. With priority inheritance, the priority of the lower-priority task is temporarily raised to the priority of the blocked higher-priority task, which allows the higher-priority task to run and release the semaphore.

**Wait times:** Semaphores can be used to block a task for a specified period of time, which can be useful in situations where the task needs to wait for a resource to become available. FreeRTOS supports both blocking and non-blocking semaphore acquisition, and the wait times can be specified in tick counts or in milliseconds.

## In summary
 
semaphores in FreeRTOS are an essential synchronization mechanism that allow tasks to coordinate their access to shared resources in a safe and efficient manner. They provide a flexible and reliable way to manage resource sharing and mutual exclusion, while also preventing priority inversion and supporting configurable wait times.
